# Stream One - Front End Project

## Overview

### What is this app for?

This app is designed to be a source if information for the famous rapper, Drake. The app contains navigation which can take you to background history, media available to browse including audio and video, tour information and a contact form for enquiries. The app is fully client side, so the contact form doesn't go anywhere, but it still has means of validation. The app has been designed to be fully responsive, and it was created using guidelines for the stream one project for the full stack developer course by the code institute.

### Some the tech used includes:

- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
    - I have used **AngularJS** to handle page routing (with angular-route). I have also built custom directives to neaten up the views used by the routing, and controllers to help with the functionality of certain views. 
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
    - I have used **Bootstrap** to allow me to style my app with relative ease. It has helped towards making the app fully responsive, and has also helped to make the navigation neater and easier.
- [JQuery](https.//jquery.com/)
	- I have used **JQuery** to allow faster and easier scripting for certain functions.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
    - I have used **npm** to help manage some of the dependencies in my application.
- [bower](https://bower.io/)
    - I have used **Bower** to manage the installation of our libraries and frameworks. It is much faster and neater to use **Bower** in the command line, as opposed to going to the vendors directly.

### Other Contributions

Along with most of the app being written by myself, i have also relied on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) in order to help me understand and fix any problems i may have encoutered. I also compiled my navbar-collapse.js from different posts on S.O, and have used [Google](https://google.com/) to help with other areas of the project.
