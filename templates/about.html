			<p id="tabsize"> Drake, full name Aubrey Drake Graham (born October 24, 1986) is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer and previously an actor. Hailing from Toronto, his early career began when he was just 15 years old, with a part on the hit Canadian teen show, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrassi:_The_Next_Generation">'Degrassi : The Next Generation'</a>. After spending 4 years with the Degrassi cast, he decided to embark on a different path towards a musical career instead. In 2006, after becoming musically inspired by the stars at that time, such as 'Jay-Z', Drake self released his debut mixtape, 'Room For Improvement'. Less than a year later, Drake's second mixtape 'Comeback Season' saw the light of day, with guest features from the likes of Trey Songz. The mixtape was released by his newly founded company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OVO_Sound">'October's Very Own'</a>, or 'OVO' for short. With a certain hype beginning to arise around an unsigned Drake, already well established rapper 'Lil Wayne'caught wind, and invited Drake to join him on his tour.</p>

			<p id="tabsize">Even with successful collaborations between the two on tour, Drake still remained unsigned by a major record label. in 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, 'So Far Gone' which was available for free download through the OVO website. With more collaborations from 'Trey Songz' and 'Lil Wayne' featured on the album, it was a pivotal point for Drake's career as a bidding war ensued from various labels to sign him. Remaining true to his now good friend 'Lil Wayne', he signed to his record label <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Money_Entertainment">'Young Money Entertainment'</a>. With the mixtapes recieveing more and more commercial success as Drake became more popular, Drake released his first major album, 'Thank Me Later'. The album saw almost 450,000 sales within it's first week, and songs featured on the album landed Drake places in the top billboard 100, as well as nominations for varuois awards including Grammies. Drake's second studio album was released in November 2011, with the title of 'Take care'. The album was named as such, after Drake stated "I didn’t get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed a lot of the songs and sonically I didn’t get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That’s why my new album is called Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round."</p>

			<p id="tabsize">Take care was a great commercial success, with the likes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME">'NME'</a> and other critics dubbing it a masterpiece. Each single released from the album was an instant hit, as well as the song 'The Motto' creating a large societal impact by popularising the word 'YOLO'. the album went on to become quadruple platinum, with other 2.6 million copies sold in the US alone. 'Take Care' also won Drake the grammy award for best rap album at the 55th annual grammy awards. On the back of the album's success, Drake embarked on his worldwide 'Club Paradise' tour, which became the highest grossing hip hop tour of 2012, grossing over 42 million dollars. Drakes third major album 'Nothing Was the Same' was released in September 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the UK. Drake began another tour after the success of the album, on which he began writing new music. Without warning or advirtisement, he released 'If You're Reading This It's Too Late' in February, 2015. Deemed to be a mixtape rather than an album, it still became a great commercial success, even without prior advirtisement. The album sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall. Drake proceeded 'If You're Reading This It's Too Late' with a collaborative mixtape with rapper 'Future' in September 2015, which was recorded in just under a week. The album, titled 'What A Time To Be Alive' was later certified platinum by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America">'Recording Industry Association of America'</a>, for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units. Drake's fourth studio album, 'View's was released in april 2016. 'View's would become Drake's most commercially successful album, achieving double platinum status in the U.S, as well as sitting atop various charts for upto 10 non consecutvie weeks. Continuing to tour the world, in March of 2017 Drake released another album, entitled 'More Life' which saw a track list of 22 tracks, which is his biggest album listing to date. With every album, mixtape or tour being a success, Drake has gone from strength to strength, and is continuing to write music, as well as branching back out into commercial TV.</p>
